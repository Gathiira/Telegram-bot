# Telegram-bot, 100% python
Telegram bot for ordering items online.
- The bot was developed as a result of curiosity of what Telegram is capable of.
- The project became detailed, and I had to stop it before it could consume me.
- I managed to host it at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ for sometimes, but they killed it as it required premium services.
- Interested party can clone the repo and refactor the code to suit their needs.
#### Please treat it with care as it consumed almost two months of my precious time. LOL
